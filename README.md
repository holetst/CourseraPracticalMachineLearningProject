# Coursera - Practical Machine Learning - Course Project
Current repository includes outputs of the Course Project completed within Practical Machine Learning Course.
You can find here files PML_ProjectOutput.Rmd and PML_ProjectOutput.html which include details on the performed analysis (respective code, comments, and outputs).
Within the files, I describe what I expect the out of sample error to be and estimate the error with cross-validation.
